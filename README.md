## GBIF Species Migration Project: Orca (2025)

For this project, I downloaded 2025 Orca (Orcinus orca) sightings from GBIF and explored where they were showing up globally. I mapped the locations, looked at which countries had the most observations, and wrote a short reflection on the patterns I noticed.

## Vegetation Health on the Gila River (2025)

For this project, I worked through the full vegetation workflow along the Gila River using satellite data and NDVI. Each notebook breaks down a different step in the process, from setup to wrangling to plotting and summarizing the results.
