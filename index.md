## GBIF Species Migration Project: Orca (2025)



For this project, I downloaded 2025 Orca (Orcinus orca) sightings from GBIF and explored where they were showing up globally. I mapped the locations, looked at which countries had the most observations, and wrote a short reflection on the patterns I noticed.
